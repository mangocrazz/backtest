Quantitative Trading Strategy Framework
Overview
Welcome to the Quantitative Trading Strategy Framework. This repository encapsulates a sophisticated and modular approach to constructing and backtesting trading strategies using single-factor analysis. It is designed for quantitative researchers and trading professionals seeking to implement and evaluate the performance of financial models in a real-world environment.

Features
Data Processing Module: Handles the extraction, transformation, and preparation of high-frequency financial data to ensure robustness in subsequent analyses.

Backtesting Engine: Implements a comprehensive backtesting framework that allows for rigorous assessment of trading strategies, incorporating various statistical measures and performance indicators.

Utility Functions: Includes a suite of visualization tools to aid in the interpretation and communication of results, facilitating a deeper understanding of strategy performance.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
You can install them via pip:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

Usage
Data Preparation: The data_processing.py module is responsible for loading and preparing data. It ensures that the data is properly formatted and ready for analysis.

Strategy Backtesting: The backtest.py module encapsulates the logic for evaluating trading strategies. It applies the linear regression model to predict future price movements and simulates trading scenarios based on these predictions.

Visualization: Use the utils.py module to visualize the results of your backtest, helping you interpret the efficacy of the trading strategy.

Run the main application by executing:

python main.py
Architecture
The framework is built on a modular architecture, allowing each component to be developed, tested, and refined independently. This design facilitates the extension of the framework to accommodate more complex models, such as non-linear regression, machine learning algorithms, or alternative financial instruments.
